  <h1>Thoughts About Interior Design</h1>
  <h2>Like movies, music, and fashion, interior design has a world of its own</h2>

  <p>On the surface interior design can seem like such a simple thing. That couldn't be farther from the truth. There are so many intricate things to consider and an endlist sea of options to choose from. As Irene Au once said, "Good design is like a refrigerator, when it works no one notices but when it doesn't it stinks."</p>

  <p>Some things to consider first are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The shape and flow of the room</li>
    <li>What colors work well together</li>
    <li>How the shape of the furnature can effect the room(s)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The list can go on and on, but you get the gist. It can be overwhelming.</p>
  <h3>Then there are different styles to consider!</h3>
  <p>Like genres of music, interior design has a list of styles that goes on and on and on...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3><strong>Mid Century Modern</strong></h3>

      <h3><strong>Mediterranean</strong></h3>

      <h3><strong>Minimalism</strong></h3>

      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are just some examples of different design styles. There are hundreds to choose from and, like the three listed above, some tie into each other really well. One of these rooms could easily flow into another using complementary colors, similar furnature, etc.</p>
  <h3>Choose what works best for you!</h3>
  <p>Ultimately the goal is to find what you like the most, and like whith anything, you don't want to base decisions solely off of what someone else is doing. Look inward! What color makes you feel the most warm and fuzzy? Do you like round edges on coffee tables? Or perhaps the whole thing should be circular? If you ask yourself (and maybe <a href="https://www.google.com/?&bih=592&biw=1366&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1006US1006&hl=en"><strong>Google</strong></a>) enough questions then you might just stumble onto something special.</p>
